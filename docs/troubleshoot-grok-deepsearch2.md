ANSWER GROK 3 DEEP SEARCH

Key Points

Research suggests there may be timing issues with HashConnect 0.2.9 and the HashPack extension on Mainnet, where pairingEvent fails despite a "Paired/Connected" state, likely due to calling pairing functions too early.
It seems likely that a small delay (300–800ms) before calling openPairingModal() is recommended to allow the extension to initialize, based on community reports.
The evidence leans toward including metadata.url in the appMetadata object, which may conflict with setups like HeliSwap if omitted, as it is required for proper functionality.
Using init(..., true) enables debug mode, which can be helpful for troubleshooting but should be false in production, with no specific version requirements noted.
Official guidance suggests using openPairingModal() to initiate pairing for legacy extensions, while connectToLocalWallet() is part of the subsequent connection flow.


Direct Answer
Overview
Connecting your React app to the Hedera HashPack Chrome extension can face issues, especially with HashConnect 0.2.9 on Mainnet (legacy). Here’s a breakdown of your concerns, written in simple terms to help you troubleshoot.
Timing and Pairing Issues
If the pairingEvent fails on Mainnet despite showing "Paired/Connected," it’s likely due to timing. Research suggests this happens when you try to pair before the HashPack extension is fully ready, a common issue with HashConnect 0.2.9. Adding a small delay (like 500ms) before starting the pairing process can help.
Delay Before Pairing
Yes, it’s recommended to wait 300–800ms before calling openPairingModal() or connectToLocalWallet(). This gives the extension time to initialize, reducing errors. For example, you can use setTimeout(hashConnect.openPairingModal, 500); to ensure everything is set up.
Metadata URL Requirement
Your app needs to include a metadata.url in the setup, like `'[invalid url, do not cite] for local testing or your live site URL. If setups like HeliSwap skip this, it might cause problems, as it’s required for HashConnect to work properly.
Debug Mode in Initialization
When setting up, you can use init(..., true) to turn on debug mode, which helps find issues. But for your live app, set it to false. There’s no specific need to use true for certain extension versions, but it’s great for testing.
Choosing Pairing Methods
For legacy extensions, start with openPairingModal() to begin pairing—this shows a popup for the user. Then, connectToLocalWallet() kicks in as part of the connection process after pairing. Stick to openPairingModal() to start, as it’s the standard way.

Survey Note
This section provides a comprehensive analysis of the HashPack browser wallet connection issues, specifically focusing on HashConnect 0.2.9 and the current HashPack extension on Mainnet (legacy), addressing the user's detailed queries. The discussion is informed by available documentation, community discussions, and practical examples, aiming to cover all relevant details for a thorough understanding.
Background and Context
The Hedera HashPack is a wallet for the Hedera network, available as a Chrome extension, which allows users to interact with decentralized applications (dApps). Your React app is using the HashConnect library (version 0.2.9) to facilitate this connection, enabling features like wallet pairing and transaction signing. The connection process involves several steps, including initialization, event registration, and pairing, which can be disrupted by timing issues, configuration errors, or version-specific behaviors, especially on Mainnet with legacy extensions.
The user has raised specific concerns about pairingEvent failing despite a "Paired/Connected" state, the need for delays before pairing functions, metadata requirements, initialization parameters, and the choice between openPairingModal() and connectToLocalWallet() for legacy extension pairing. These issues are analyzed below, drawing from the latest available information as of August 8, 2025.
Analysis of PairingEvent Failures on Mainnet
The first question is whether there is a known issue in HashConnect 0.2.9 with the current HashPack extension where pairingEvent fails on Mainnet (legacy) despite showing a "Paired/Connected" state. Research suggests that timing issues are a common cause, particularly when openPairingModal() is called before the HashPack extension has fully initialized. This can lead to errors like "URI missing," as noted in community discussions (e.g., StackOverflow reports), where the pairing string is undefined, preventing the pairingEvent from firing.
While specific documentation for HashConnect 0.2.9 does not explicitly list Mainnet pairing failures, the behavior is consistent with testnet issues reported, where premature calls to pairing functions result in failed events. Given the similarity, it seems likely that Mainnet, especially with legacy extensions, faces the same challenge due to the extension's initialization timing.
Delay Before Calling Pairing Functions
The second question addresses whether a small delay (e.g., 300–800ms) before calling connectToLocalWallet() or openPairingModal() is recommended to let the extension finish initializing. The evidence leans toward yes, based on community solutions. For instance, a StackOverflow discussion highlighted that adding a 500ms delay using setTimeout(hashConnect.openPairingModal, 500); resolved pairing issues by ensuring the HashPack extension was ready. This delay range (300–800ms) is reasonable to accommodate varying initialization times, especially for legacy extensions that might take longer to load.
The recommendation is supported by the observation that calling these functions too early can lead to errors like "URI missing," indicating the pairing string isn't ready. Therefore, implementing such a delay is a practical approach to ensure reliable pairing.
Metadata.URL Requirement and Conflicts
The third question is about any requirement to include metadata.url that might conflict with setups like HeliSwap’s omission. The appMetadata object, which includes fields like name, description, icons, and url, is required for HashConnect initialization. Documentation examples consistently show metadata.url set to the dApp's URL, such as `'[invalid url, do not cite] for local development or the production URL. Omitting this field can lead to configuration errors, as it is used for identifying the dApp during pairing.
If HeliSwap omits metadata.url, it likely deviates from standard practice, potentially causing issues with the pairing process. The evidence leans toward including metadata.url as a mandatory field to ensure compatibility and proper functionality, and any conflict with such setups should be addressed by ensuring all required metadata is provided.
Initialization with Debug Mode
The fourth question is whether init(..., true) should be used for direct extension flows on certain extension versions. The fourth parameter in the init function enables debug mode, as seen in examples like hashconnect = new HashConnect(LedgerId.TESTNET, walletConnectProjectId, appMetadata, true);. This mode is useful for troubleshooting, providing additional console logs and error messages, but there is no specific guidance tying it to certain extension versions for direct flows.
For production, it is recommended to set this parameter to false to disable debug mode, ensuring optimal performance. While debug mode can help diagnose issues, it is not a requirement for functionality and should be used selectively during development.
Guidance on Pairing Methods
The fifth question seeks official guidance on using openPairingModal() vs connectToLocalWallet() for legacy extension pairing. Documentation and examples indicate that openPairingModal() is the standard method to initiate the pairing process, displaying a popup with a pairing code and QR code for the user to connect their wallet. This is the recommended approach for both legacy and current extensions, as it triggers the pairing flow.
On the other hand, connectToLocalWallet() is part of the internal connection flow that occurs after metadata is received and the pairing is established, as seen in logs like "Connecting to local wallet" following "Finding local wallets." For legacy extension pairing, the process should start with openPairingModal(), followed by handling the pairingEvent and subsequent connection events, making it the primary method for initiating pairing.
Detailed Steps for Implementation
To implement the solutions, consider the following code structure for your React app, ensuring all best practices are followed:
javascriptimport React, { useEffect } from 'react';
import { HashConnect, LedgerId } from 'hashconnect';

const App = () => {
  useEffect(() => {
    const hashconnect = new HashConnect(LedgerId.MAINNET, "<Your Project ID>", {
      name: "Your App Name",
      description: "Your App Description",
      icons: ["[invalid url, do not cite]"],
      url: "[invalid url, do not cite]" // Ensure this is set
    }, false); // Set to false for production

    // Register events before initializing
    hashconnect.pairingEvent.on((newPairing) => {
      console.log("Pairing event fired:", newPairing);
      // Handle pairing data here
    });

    // Initialize Hashconnect
    hashconnect.init();

    // Add delay before opening pairing modal
    setTimeout(() => {
      hashconnect.openPairingModal();
    }, 500);
  }, []);

  return <div>Your App Content</div>;
};

export default App;
Ensure to replace placeholders with actual values and test thoroughly, especially on Mainnet with legacy extensions.

HashConnect is currently under active development and is available in open beta. There are numerous projects which have already integrated HashConnect into their workflow, providing users with a great user experience.

To get started, check out the NPM package which includes a documentation and a demo that demonstrates pairing and signing functionality. The main functionality of HashConnect is to send Hedera transactions to a wallet to be signed and executed by a user. It uses message relay nodes to communicate between apps, meaning that HashConnect transactions are not recorded on the ledger.

hashconnect - npm
Hashconnect uses message relay nodes to communicate between apps. These nodes use something called a topic ID to publish/subscribe to. It is your responsibility to maintain (using localstorage or a cookie or something) topic ID's and hashconnect encryption keys between user visits. Pairing is the term used to denote a connection between two apps. Generally pairing is the action of exchanging a topic ID and a metadata object. Each message has a message ID that will be returned by the function used to send the message. Any events that reference a previously sent message will include the relevant message id, this allows you to wait for specific actions to be completed or be notified when specific messages have been rejected by the user. We recommend getting familiar with how async/await works before using Hashconnect. We also strongly suggest using Typescript.

TLS Handshake Failed: Client- and Server-side Fixes & Advice
Obviously, this cuts down on the time that it takes for a connection to start — we’re talking milliseconds here so maybe not noticeably (except at scale) — and makes everything more efficient. TLS 1.3 also allows 0-RTT resumption, which streamlines subsequent connections to a TLS 1.3-enabled website even more. But, given the number of moving parts in a TLS handshake, there’s plenty that can go wrong if a website or a device are misconfigured. A couple years ago we wrote about fixing TLS handshakes failed errors on Firefox, but these errors are far more universal than that. So now let’s talk about what can go wrong with the TLS handshake and what need to be done to fix it. ... There’s a lot going on underneath the hood when you connect to a website via HTTPS. First and foremost, everyone needs to… shake hands?! ... To make this article a little bit easier to follow, we’re going to put all of the possible causes for SSL/TLS handshake failed errors (SSL handshake errors) and who can fix them.
