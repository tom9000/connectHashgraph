# HashPack Wallet Connection - Work in Progress (2025-08-07)

## Summary

We have successfully implemented HashPack wallet connection with the desired "legacy" checkbox UI, but are still working to resolve automatic pairing completion due to persistent decryption errors.

## Current Status

### ✅ **Working Features**
- **Checkbox UI**: Successfully achieved the legacy HashPack UI with square checkboxes instead of radio buttons
- **Network-based UI**: Confirmed that mainnet shows checkboxes, testnet shows radio buttons
- **Manual connection**: Users can complete connection by manually entering account ID when prompted
- **Connection state management**: Proper state tracking and UI updates
- **Dual connection modes**: "HashPack Legacy (Mainnet)" and "HashPack New (Testnet)" buttons

### ❌ **Outstanding Issues**
- **Decryption errors**: HashConnect shows "Connected" status but `Invalid encrypted text received. Decryption halted.` prevents automatic pairing event
- **Empty pairing data**: `pairingData` array remains empty `[]` in localStorage despite successful connection
- **Manual intervention required**: Users must enter account ID manually to complete connection

## Technical Investigation

### Versions Tested
- **HashConnect**: 0.2.9 (matching HeliSwap exactly)
- **@hashgraph/sdk**: ^2.69.0
- **Network**: mainnet (for checkbox UI)

### Initialization Patterns Tested

#### 1. HeliSwap Exact Pattern
```javascript
// Constructor
this.hashconnect = new HashConnect(true)

// Initialization
await this.hashconnect.init(appMetadata, 'mainnet', false)

// Storage management
localStorage.clear() // Complete clear like HeliSwap
```

#### 2. Multi-wallet Pattern
```javascript
// Same constructor but different init parameter
await this.hashconnect.init(appMetadata, 'mainnet', true)
```

#### 3. App Metadata Variations
- Tried exact HeliSwap metadata format
- Tested different app names and descriptions
- No impact on decryption errors

### Storage Management Approaches Tested

#### 1. Aggressive Cleanup
- Cleared all HashConnect-related localStorage keys
- **Result**: Made decryption errors worse

#### 2. Minimal Cleanup
- Only cleared network-specific keys
- **Result**: Same decryption errors

#### 3. Complete localStorage.clear()
- HeliSwap-style complete storage clearing
- **Result**: Fresh sessions but still decryption errors

#### 4. No Cleanup (Current)
- Trust HashConnect's internal storage management
- **Result**: Best approach but decryption still fails

### Reference Implementation Analysis

Analyzed multiple working implementations:

#### HeliSwap Frontend (Working ✅)
- Uses `hashconnect@0.2.9`
- Constructor: `new HashConnect(true)`
- Init: `init(metadata, network, false)`
- Storage: `localStorage.clear()` on disconnect

#### Multi-wallet JS (Working ✅)
- Uses `hashconnect@0.2.4`
- Constructor: `new HashConnect()`
- Init: `init(metadata, network, true)`
- Different third parameter usage

#### Key Finding
Both working implementations use different combinations of debug flags and init parameters, suggesting the third parameter in `init()` is critical for encryption behavior.

## Error Pattern

### Consistent Sequence
1. HashConnect initializes successfully
2. `connectToLocalWallet()` called
3. HashPack extension shows pairing UI with checkboxes ✅
4. User completes pairing in HashPack ✅
5. HashPack logs show "Paired" status ✅
6. HashConnect status shows "Connected" ✅
7. **Decryption error occurs**: `Invalid encrypted text received. Decryption halted.`
8. `pairingEvent` never fires
9. `pairingData` array remains empty `[]`

### Browser Console Evidence
```
hashconnect - decryption with key: [key-id]
Uncaught (in promise) Error: Invalid encrypted text received. Decryption halted.
```

### HashPack Extension Evidence
```
hashconnect state change event Connected
hashconnect state change event Paired
```

## Current Workaround

### Manual Account ID Entry
When automatic pairing fails:
1. System detects HashConnect "Connected" status
2. Prompts user for account ID (format: `0.0.123456`)
3. Manually completes connection state
4. User reaches logged-in page successfully

### Implementation
```javascript
const accountId = prompt(
  'HashPack connection established, but automatic account detection failed due to encryption issues.\n\n' +
  'Please enter your HashPack account ID (format: 0.0.123456):'
)

if (accountId && accountId.match(/^0\.0\.\d+$/)) {
  this.state.accountIds = [accountId]
  this.state.selectedAccountId = accountId
  this.state.isConnected = true
  // Connection completed
}
```

## Next Steps for Resolution

### Potential Solutions to Investigate

#### 1. HashConnect Version Testing
- Test with `hashconnect@0.2.4` (multi-wallet version)
- Test with older versions (0.1.x series)

#### 2. Environment Factors
- Browser extension version compatibility
- WebSocket relay server issues
- CORS or security policy conflicts

#### 3. Encryption Key Management
- Investigation into why encryption keys become invalid
- Protocol version mismatches between dApp and HashPack

#### 4. Alternative Libraries
- Consider newer `@hashgraph/hedera-wallet-connect` library
- Evaluate if migration would resolve encryption issues

### Debugging Approaches
1. **Deep packet inspection**: Monitor WebSocket messages between dApp and relay
2. **Extension debugging**: Access HashPack extension's internal state
3. **Protocol analysis**: Compare working vs non-working message formats
4. **Fresh environment testing**: Clean browser profile, different machines

## Conclusion

We have achieved the primary goal of checkbox UI and functional wallet connection, but automatic pairing remains blocked by decryption errors that appear to be a protocol-level issue between our dApp's HashConnect implementation and the HashPack extension.

The manual workaround provides full functionality while we continue investigating the root cause of the encryption mismatch.
